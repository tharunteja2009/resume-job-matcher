```
📄 Upload PDFs → 🤖 AI Processing → 💾 Smart Storage → 🧠 Semantic Matching → 📊 Scored Results
```

### **Key Benefits**
- ✅ **95% Time Reduction** in initial screening
- ✅ **Objective AI Scoring** with detailed justifications  
- ✅ **Semantic Understanding** beyond keyword matching
- ✅ **Real-time Cost Monitoring** for budget control
- ✅ **Production-Ready Architecture** for enterprise deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/tharunteja2009/autogen-with-rag.git
cd resume-job-matcher

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirement.txt

# 3. Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# 4. Run the complete pipeline
python main.py
```

**That's it!** The system will process all resumes and job descriptions, perform AI matching, and show you detailed cost analytics.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 💰 Cost Tracking & Optimization

One of the key differentiators of this system is comprehensive **real-time cost monitoring** for all OpenAI API usage.

### **Automatic Cost Tracking**
- **Every API call** is automatically tracked with token counts and costs
- **Real-time analytics** show spending as operations progress  
- **Detailed breakdowns** by operation type (parsing vs. matching vs. RAG)
- **Session summaries** provide complete cost analysis

### **Sample Cost Output**
```
💰 TOKEN USAGE & COST ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════
⏱️ Session Duration: 2.45 minutes
🔢 Total API Calls: 8
💵 Estimated Total Cost: $0.0892

📊 MODEL BREAKDOWN:
• GPT-3.5-turbo: $0.0159 (parsing tasks)
