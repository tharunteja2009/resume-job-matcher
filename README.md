Business requirement :

This portal for technical recruiter, who upload candidate resume document and job description document to portal. Which will rate the list of candidate profile based on jobs description and also provide the reason why it is best suitable for the job give full summmary.

1. recriter Upload resume of the candidate
2. Parse the resume pdf file, then fetch experince, skills and projects etc
3. Save files in json format then save in mongo DB
4. then recruiter upload jd of job opportunity which have expected skills and job responsibilities
5. add the job expected skillset and responsibilites in mem0 using RAG
6. once recruiter click on process button on portal.

A socity of team in autogen consists with 

agent 1: resume parser agent 
            it will parse the list of resume's then fetch experince details, skills and projects store in mongo D for tracking and mem0 + vector db for Agent 
            Note : LLM prompts to extract structured data more accurately from raw PDF text. then store in mem0 + vector db

agent 2: job document parser agent
            it will parese the job description then fetch expected skills and job responsibilities store in mongo D for tracking and mem0 + vector db for Agent 
            Note : LLM prompts to extract structured data more accurately from raw PDF text. then store in mem0 + vector db

agent 3: talent rater agent
            it will compare 
            a. list of resume's and their skills atleast partial match with  job description document skills
            b. project details partial match with job responsibilities
            c. years of experiance with mentioned skill in resume is higher then high rating score , if the skill match happend in step (a)
            d. Generate summary for each candidate with matching score based on above step a to c also recommendation why he is suitable for role


Technologies :

microsoft autogen - for agents creation and workflow
mongo DB - for tracking of uploads to portal
mem0 + rag - for both agents store their context , one is resume another one is job.
python - for programing
pdfplumber - for pdf parsing of resume or job description
fastAPI - for api development of /uploadcv, /uploadjd and /processjobbycv
streamlit - for ui development by integrating with flask api
ngroc - expose API to public environment


Let me know if any gap in my understanding for develpment of above project. Any new technologies used or any easy approch of autogen agent workflow

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chat GTP analysis on my reqirement :

Your updated project description is very close to being complete and well-structured. You‚Äôve clearly outlined the:
	‚Ä¢	Business Requirement
	‚Ä¢	Workflow
	‚Ä¢	Agent Roles
	‚Ä¢	Technology Stack

However, a few minor gaps, clarifications, and recommendations remain for scalability, clarity, and real-world implementation. Here‚Äôs a detailed review with feedback and optional improvements.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Correct / Clear
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Three Agents well defined (Resume Parser, JD Parser, Talent Rater)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ LLM prompts for extraction: Yes, good that you‚Äôre using LLMs for structured extraction.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use of mem0 + vector DB: Great for RAG support.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ MongoDB for tracking is sensible.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Endpoints /uploadcv, /uploadjd, /processjobbycv are well-scoped.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Technologies chosen are lightweight and good for MVP or production.

‚∏ª

üîç Minor Gaps & Suggestions

üî∏ 1. Clarify Data Flow Between Agents

Right now it‚Äôs implicit ‚Äî make it explicit how agents communicate or pass data:
	‚Ä¢	Do they share context via mem0?
	‚Ä¢	Are you chaining them in a custom workflow or orchestrated via AutoGen‚Äôs GroupChat?

üìå Recommendation: Define Agent Communication Flow, e.g.,

Recruiter uploads Resume ‚ûù ResumeParserAgent stores structured data ‚ûù JDParserAgent runs after JD upload ‚ûù TalentRaterAgent runs only after both resume and JD are parsed.


‚∏ª

üî∏ 2. Resume & JD Parsing Output Format

Define a common JSON schema for:
	‚Ä¢	Resume: name, skills, years_of_experience, projects
	‚Ä¢	JD: required_skills, responsibilities, experience_required

üìå Why?
Makes matching deterministic. Otherwise, LLM-based extraction could return varied formats.

‚∏ª

üî∏ 3. Use Embeddings for Partial Matching

You mentioned ‚Äúpartial match‚Äù ‚Äî this needs semantic similarity (not exact match).

üìå Recommendation:
	‚Ä¢	Use OpenAI embeddings, Instructor, or SentenceTransformers to embed:
	‚Ä¢	Candidate skills / projects
	‚Ä¢	JD skills / responsibilities

Then use cosine similarity threshold (e.g., 0.7) for match logic.

‚∏ª

üî∏ 4. Vector DB Choice

You‚Äôre using ‚Äúvector DB‚Äù ‚Äî be specific:
	‚Ä¢	ChromaDB (lightweight)
	‚Ä¢	FAISS (local)
	‚Ä¢	Weaviate / Pinecone (cloud, scalable)

üìå Recommendation: Start with ChromaDB if you‚Äôre building a local prototype.

‚∏ª

üî∏ 5. Use LangChain / LlamaIndex with AutoGen (optional)

For RAG and memory management, LangChain or LlamaIndex could enhance:
	‚Ä¢	Chunking logic
	‚Ä¢	Query routing
	‚Ä¢	Memory management

üìå Not mandatory but helpful for better modularity.

‚∏ª

üî∏ 6. Streamlit ‚Üî Flask/FastAPI UI

Make sure:
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit UI calls backend endpoints via requests
	‚Ä¢	Show:
	‚Ä¢	Resume Upload
	‚Ä¢	JD Upload
	‚Ä¢	Match Results Table (Name, Match %, Summary, Recommendation)

üìå Recommendation: Cache results with Streamlit session state.

‚∏ª

üî∏ 7. Async Execution (Optional)

If you plan to process multiple resumes:
	‚Ä¢	Consider using FastAPI + async
	‚Ä¢	Or integrate a background task queue (Celery, RQ, etc.)

Area	Status	Notes
Agent Design	‚úÖ Complete	All agents are defined well
Use of mem0 + Vector DB	‚úÖ Good	Ensure consistent format of inputs
Resume & JD Parsing	‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è	Add structured schema definition
Partial Match Logic	‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Embeddings	Use cosine similarity

‚úÖ Do You Need Help With‚Ä¶

Let me know if you want me to:
	‚Ä¢	Draft the AutoGen YAML config for the agents?
	‚Ä¢	Write a starter Python function for parsing resumes with LLM + pdfplumber?
	‚Ä¢	Suggest vector DB schema for embedding + matching?

Let‚Äôs implement step by step!
